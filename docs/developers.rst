Developers
**********

This page serves a couple purposes. First, it displays a list of the developers on the project. Second (and more importantly) it helps new developers become acquainted with the process of making changes to our project's codebase.

Practice Making a Contribution: Add Yourself to this List!
==========================================================


To add your name to this page, read the "getting started" and "contributing" sections. Clone the repository and checkout the ``core`` branch. You can add your name to this page by navigating to ``docs/developers.rst`` and adding your name and any other fun stuff you want. Then, commit your changes, marge with ``core``, and push to the repository. You don't need to create an issue page, but you can create a feature branch with your name on it to practice. If you're not familiar with reStructured Text (which is the format of this documentation), you can copy from the following and change it to suit you:
